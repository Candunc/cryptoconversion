CryptoConversion
================

CryptoConversion is a JavaScript conversion tool utilizing Bootstrap and the Poloniex API to convert one cryptocurrency into another through an intermediary step. 

Eventually I'd like to be able to configure / lock the values so that you can play around and find the best deal to trade at. This is a barely working proof of concept, so use at your own risk.
